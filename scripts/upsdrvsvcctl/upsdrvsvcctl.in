Network UPS Tools - UPS driver controller ${PACKAGE_VERSION}
Starts and stops UPS drivers via system service instances, see
the $ENUMERATOR
script for more details.

usage: $0 [OPTIONS] (start | stop | shutdown) [<ups>]

Options:
  -h            	display this help
  -t            	testing mode - prints actions without doing them
  -D            	raise debugging level
  --timeout-cmd <prog>	service management calls will be time-limited
  --timeout-args <arg>	by calling the specified program with its args.
                    	By default, if coreutils timeout is found, it
                    	would be used to limit service calls by 90 sec.
  start         	start all UPS drivers in ups.conf
  start <ups>   	only start driver for UPS <ups>
  stop          	stop all UPS drivers in ups.conf
  stop <ups>    	only stop driver for UPS <ups>

Note: the "shutdown" options from original upsdrvctl are not currently
directly supported by this service management framework wrapper; instead
they are passed to the native upsdrvctl binary (your current user account
should have sufficient permissions to do that all):
  shutdown      	shutdown all UPS drivers in ups.conf
  shutdown <ups>	only shutdown UPS <ups>

usage: $0 [OPTIONS] resync
  resync        	call $ENUMERATOR
                	to update the mapping of service instances for
                	NUT drivers to device sections in 'ups.conf'

usage: $0 [OPTIONS] reconfigure
  reconfigure   	call $ENUMERATOR
                	to remove and re-create the mapping of all service
                	instances for NUT drivers to device sections in
                	'ups.conf' e.g. after a NUT package upgrade

usage: $0 [OPTIONS] list [<ups>]
  list          	call $ENUMERATOR
                	to list the mapping of service instances to device sections
  list <ups>    	(optionally return the service instance name for one device)

usage: $0 [OPTIONS] show-config [<ups>]
  show-config <ups>	output config section from ups.conf for device <ups>
  show-config   	...or all devices if no <ups> argument was passed
