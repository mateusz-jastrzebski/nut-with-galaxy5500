NUT resources for systemd integration
=====================================

Overview
--------

This directory contains the NUT support files for `systemd`, the System and
Service Manager used in many Linux distributions.

These files are automatically installed, upon detection (at `configure` time)
of a systemd enabled target system, or if corresponding configuration options
were requested.

This also uses the `nut-driver-enumerator.sh` (service and implementation
method) and `upsdrvsvcctl` (tool) to manage NUT drivers as service instances
located in `../upsdrvsvcctl/` source subdirectory.

Two service bundles are provided for this:

* a set of `nut-driver-enumerator-daemon*` units starts the script as a
  daemon to regularly inspect and apply the NUT configuration to OS service
  unit wrappings (mainly intended for monitoring systems with a dynamic
  set of monitored power devices, or for systems where filesystem events
  monitoring is not a clockwork-reliable mechanism to 100% rely on);
* the other `nut-driver-enumerator.*` units run the script once per triggering
  of the service (usually during boot-up; configuration file changes can be
  detected and propagated by systemd most of the time).
