To easily compile `wdi-simple.exe`, unzip a copy of `libwdi` on your disk.

Then set it up to be able to build following
http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/libwdi/index.php?title=Install

NOTE: Modern development may be at https://github.com/pbatard/libwdi

Then copy `wdi-simple.c` and `nutscan-usb.h` into the "examples"
subdirectory of libwdi directory.

Finally run `ddk_build.cmd` from the root of the `libwdi` directory.
